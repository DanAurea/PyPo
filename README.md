# Python Points Observer

PyPo is a small library that allows observation of points through usage of OpenGL.
There's alot of resources for point cloud viewer in other languages but there's few in Python that give user access
to analysis tools such as those that can be found on WebViz, PCL, VTK etc...

PyPo require PySide2 as it's targetting use of Qt as window manager but its code could be ported on other framework without
alot of difficulties.

# Purpose

The main purpose of PyPo is to provide anyone an easy way to display and manipulate points cloud through Python.
